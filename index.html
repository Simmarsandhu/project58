 <p>Basketball is my favourite sport of all time .I know alot about the game and I love to practice it in my free time. This game needs lots of skills , hardwork and practice. Basketball is a great way of exercise and a great way to learn teamwork.Basketball has a very fast and exciting pace of play.
      I just love this game and I want to become a good basketball player when I grow up.</p>
